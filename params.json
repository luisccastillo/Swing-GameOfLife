{"name":"Swing Game of Life","tagline":"A Java Swing implementation of Conway's Game of Life and rule families","body":"#The Game of Life\r\nAlso known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.\r\n\r\nThe \"game\" is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input.\r\nOne interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves or, for advanced players,by creating patterns with particular properties. [1]\r\n\r\n## Life rules notation\r\n\r\nLife rules are defined in the \"S/B\" form, where:\r\nS - defines counts of alive neighbors necessary for a cell to survive,\r\nB - defines counts of alive neighbors necessary for a cell to be born.\r\n\r\nNote that the count of colors (states) has no influence on next generations, because Life is a one-bit family of rules.[2]\r\n\r\n\r\n## Notable life implementations:\r\n* McCell http://www.mirekw.com/ca/whatis_mcell.html\r\n* Golly http://golly.sourceforge.net/\r\n* XLife http://conwaylife.com/wiki/Xlife\r\n\r\n### Sources\r\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life\r\n1.
